# 📁 Exchange Project: Supervised & Unsupervised Learning in Python

**Course**: Foundations of Data Analysis  
**University**: University of Vienna (Austria)  
**Semester**: 2024 Winter Semester  
**Project Type**: Individual Assignment

---

## 📍 Overview

This project was completed during an exchange semester at the University of Vienna as part of the “Foundations of Data Analysis” course.  
It consists of two practical assignments focused on **Supervised Learning** and **Unsupervised Learning**, where I directly implemented core ML algorithms using Python and visualized the results using various datasets.

## 🔷 Supervised Learning

✅ Main Topics:
- Training a **Random Forest classifier** and evaluating accuracy
- **Manual implementation of 0-1 loss-based risk function**
- **Manual implementation of 10-Fold Cross Validation** to tune `max_depth`
- Visualizing **learning curves**, **decision boundaries**, and diagnosing overfitting
- Handling **non-linearly separable data (XOR, Sphere)** using **Kernel SVM**

📄 Notebook: [`supervised.ipynb`]

## 🔷 Unsupervised Learning

### 1. Apriori Algorithm
- Association rule mining based on user movie preference data  
- **Implemented Apriori algorithm from scratch** using only built-in Python & NumPy

📄 Notebook: [`uns_Apriori_Algorithm.ipynb`]

---

### 2. Dimensionality Reduction
- **PCA implementation using SVD**, with comparison to `NMF`  
- 2D projection and visualization of feature spaces

📄 Notebook: [`uns_Dimensionality_Reduction.ipynb`]

---

### 3. Clustering
- Applied and compared: `KMeans (custom)`, `EM`, `DBSCAN`, `Agglomerative Clustering`
- Evaluated results using **NMI** and **Adjusted Rand Index**

📄 Notebook: [`uns_Clustering.ipynb`]

## 🧩 Learning Outcomes

- Gained deep understanding by **implementing ML algorithms from scratch**
- Experienced the full analysis pipeline: **data exploration → model selection → tuning → evaluation**
- Strengthened ability to apply models to real-world data through **visual insight and interpretation**

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook
